# Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence in Astronomy


Machine-learning:
> Automated processes that learn by example in order to classify, predict, discover or generate new data (Fluke & Jacobs, 2019)

Why this course ?



- Data size is increasingly larger and becomes eventualy too large to be treated by-hand.
- A number of powerful and well-implemented tools have been developed. It is better to know they exists before doing it yourself from scratch.


- We may know exactly what to do but we cannot do it by hand
- We do not know exactly how features correlate but we have the feeling that some function applied to the features may lead to



## Tasks

- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Forecasting
- Generation and Reconstruction
- Discovery
- Insight

## Tools

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Random Forests (RF)
- Support Vector machines (SVMs)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
