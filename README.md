# learning-machines
Workshop series on data analysis and machine learning for astropysics


# table of contents

## 0 - Python for data analysis 101

- Object Oriented Programming: take the green path and create a software ecosystem
- Numpy: killing the for-loop
- Scipy
- Matplotlib / k3d
- Astropy

## 1 - Optimization and modeling

- Classical modeling: least-square basics (best fit and classic uncertainty estimation)
- LSMC: exploring the parameter space with Monte-Carlo
- code parallelization (writing multiple papers at the same time)
- Bayesian optimization and the Markov-Chain (chaining drunks)
- First steps on the Bayesian side of the force : Okham's razor, systematic errors and the power of priors.
 
- examples: 
  - Non-linear model fitting
  - M1, how to deconvolve multiple emission lines along the line-of-sight ?
  - Recover orbital parameters from a luminosity curve
 
## 2 - Old school machine learning

- detect patterns with convolution
- do it faster, do it with Cython
- classification and modeling
  - PCA: how to start drawing curved lines
  - walk through random forests and let the machines show you what you fail to see

- examples:
  - find a thousand planetary nebulae in a 3 billion voxels haystack
  - redefine the regions of the BPT diagram
 
 ## 3 - Deep learning
 
Make intelligence emerge from sand and practice ethical slavery
