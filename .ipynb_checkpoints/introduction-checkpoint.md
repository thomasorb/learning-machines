# Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence in Astronomy

## Regression / Modeling

X = FREE PARAMETERS
P = INTERNAL PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL
Y = OBSERVED DATA 
Ŷ = SIMULATED DATA

Y ~ Ŷ = f(X, P)

- Regression
  - based on Y, find P
  - dimensionality reduction 
  - machine-learning: classification, 
  - data reduction

- Modeling
  - with known P: generate Ŷ, find X which fit Y
  - data fit
  - generation, forecasting, reconstruction
  




- Machine-learning:

> Automated processes that learn by example in order to classify, predict, discover or generate new data [2]



## Tasks

- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Forecasting
- Generation and Reconstruction
- Discovery
- Insight

## Tools

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Random Forests (RF)
- Support Vector machines (SVMs)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
